# BakaHoldem
Simple Texas Hold'em helper app to help one of friends of mine to learn how to play. 
Nothing special, literally mine first application for android made on my own without any course book etc.

Has a deck builder realised through spinners (tried my own keyboard, but it is not comfortable for users) with shared preferences to save states, rules and combinations list.
Localized for EN and RU.

Featuring TODO:
• gameflow with bets and blinds based on players amount;
• dynamic combinations parser based on rules (current implementation uses static strings);
• games history;
○ hold'em news parser (not sure, got another ideas to improve API usage).
